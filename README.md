2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.
*Installing Python
Windows:
Download Python Installer
Visit the official Python website: python.org/downloads
Download the latest version of Python for Windows (e.g., Python 3.10.1)
Run the Installer:
Double-click the downloaded installer (.exe file)
Check the box "Add Python x.x to PATH" during installation
Click "Install Now" (or customize the installation if needed)
Verify Installation
Open Command Prompt (cmd) or PowerShell
Type python --version or python3 --version
You should see the installed Python version number

3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.
* #This is a comment in Python
   print("Hello, World!")
  -In Python, comments start with the # character
  -The print() function in Python is used to print output to the console
  
4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.
 * Integer (int):represents whole numbers
   - age = 25
 * Floating-point number (float):represents decimal numbers
   - height = 1.75
 * String (str):represents sequences of characters, enclosed in single (') 
   or double (") quotes
   - name = "Oratile"
     message = 'Happy, Birthday.'
 * Boolean (bool):represents truth values True and False
   - is_firstName = True
 * List:ordered collection of items
   - numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
 * Tuple:similar to a list but immutable (cannot be changed after creation)
   - coordinates = (15.5, 25.5)
 * Dictionary (dict):collection of key-value pairs
   - person = {'name': 'Oratile', 'age': 15, 'country': 'South Africa'}
 
5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.
*In Python, conditional statements and loops are fundamental constructs 
 used for decision-making and repetitive tasks, respectively
*Examples:
-Conditional Statements (if-else):
 Conditional statements allow you to execute certain pieces of code based 
 on whether a condition evaluates to True or False.
-Loops (for loop):
 Loops are used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or 
 string) or execute a block of code repeatedly.

6. Functions in Python:
- What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.
*Functions in Python are blocks of organized, reusable code that perform 
 a specific task. They allow you to break down a program into smaller, 
 manageable pieces, which can be called (invoked) whenever needed. 
 Functions can take inputs (arguments), perform computations, and 
 optionally return outputs
*Benefits of using functions in Python:
 Modularity: Functions help in modularizing code, making it easier to 
 understand, reuse, and maintain.
 Code Reusability: Once defined, functions can be called multiple times 
 from different parts of the program, reducing redundancy.
 Abstraction: Functions abstract away implementation details, allowing 
 users to focus on what the function does rather than how it does it
 Testing and Debugging: Functions make it easier to test and debug code, 
 as you can isolate specific parts of the program.
*Example of a Python function:
 def sum_two_numbers(a, b):
    """
    Function to calculate the sum of two numbers.
    Parameters:
    a (int or float): First number.
    b (int or float): Second number.
    Returns:
    int or float: Sum of a and b.
    """
    return a + b

7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.
*Lists:lists are ordered collections of items where each item is indexed 
 by a number starting from 0.
- # Example of a list of numbers
  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
*Dictionaries:dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs
- # Example of a dictionary with key-value pairs
person = {
    'name': 'Oratile',
    'age': 15,
    'country': 'South Africa'
}

8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.
*Exception handling in Python is a mechanism to handle runtime errors 
 (exceptions) gracefully, preventing the program from crashing 
 unexpectedly. It allows you to catch exceptions that occur during 
 program execution and take appropriate actions
- Components of Exception Handling:
 try block:the try block is used to enclose the code that might raise an 
           exception.
except block:the except block is used to handle specific exceptions that 
             are raised in the try block.You can have multiple except 
             blocks to handle different types of exceptions.
finally block:the finally block is optional and is used to execute 
              cleanup code, whether an exception occurred or not.
              It's typically used for releasing external resources (like 
              closing a file or network connection).
Example of Exception Handling:
-def divide_numbers(a, b):
    try:
        result = a / b
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Error: Division by zero!")
    else:
        print(f"{a} divided by {b} is equal to {result}")
    finally:
        print("Executing finally block")
# Example usage
divide_numbers(10, 2)   # Normal case
divide_numbers(10, 0)   # Exception case

9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.
*Modules:a module in Python is a file containing Python definitions  
         functions, classes, variables) and statements. It serves as a 
         way to organize Python code logically into reusable units.
*Packages:a package in Python is a way to structure modules 
          hierarchically. It consists of multiple modules grouped 
          together in a directory. The directory must contain a special 
          file named __init__.py, which can be empty or contain 
          initialization code for the package.
 -Importing and Using a Module in Python:
  Example using the math module:
  The math module in Python provides access to mathematical functions and 
  constants. Here's how you can import and use the math module in your 
  script:
# Importing the math module
import math

# Using functions from the math module
print("Value of pi:", math.pi)  # Accessing the constant pi
print("Square root of 16:", math.sqrt(16))  # Calculating the square root

# Using variables from the math module
radius = 5
area_of_circle = math.pi * (radius ** 2)
print("Area of a circle with radius 5:", area_of_circle)

# Using math module functions within your own function
def calculate_hypotenuse(a, b):
    return math.sqrt(a**2 + b**2)

side1 = 3
side2 = 4
hypotenuse = calculate_hypotenuse(side1, side2)
print(f"Hypotenuse of a right triangle with sides {side1} and {side2}:", hypotenuse)

11. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.
*Python provides built-in functions and methods for reading from and 
 writing to files. These operations are fundamental for interacting with 
 external data and storing outputs
-Reading from a File steps:
Open the File: Use the open() function to open a file in read mode ('r').
Read Content: Use methods like read(), readline(), or readlines() to read 
              the content of the file.
Close the File: Always close the file after reading to free up system 
                resources.
 -Writing to a File steps:
Open the File: Use the open() function with 'w' (write) or 'a' (append) 
               mode.
Write Content: Use methods like write() to write data to the file.
Close the File: Always close the file after writing to ensure all data is 
                written and to free up system resources.
